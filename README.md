# Go Handlers

Demonstration of Go handlers


# Getting Started

  - Ensure you have Go language installed. Head on [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  - Clone this repository. I recommend inspecting each commit to see progress

Invoke the following command to install dependencies

```sh
$ go install
```

To run the go app. This one as http server

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

Access your api at `localhost:5000/api`

#### Enjoy! :)
